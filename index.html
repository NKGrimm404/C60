            My hobby is playing Hollow Knight in my free time. The game map is vast and mysterious. Every area has an impostant reason to exist. There are many characters that define the world that you're exploring. While exploring through the game you get little bits of lore here and there. You learn about Hallownest and its fall from glory. When you beat the game, you can explore the world to your heart content. Hollow Knight has one small flaw. The game is way to addicting!
        </p>

        <p>
            The main character of the game is knight who has made its way back into its home. Most people in the fandome refer the main character as "Lil Ghost". The Knight is actually nameless, genderless, and emotionless. "No cost too great. No mind to think. No will to break. No voice to cry suffering. Born of God and Void. You shall seal the blinding light that plagues their dreams. You are the Vessel." -Pale King
